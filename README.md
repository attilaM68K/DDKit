# DDKit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kyouko-taiga/DDKit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kyouko-taiga/DDKit)

DDKit is a library of Decision Diagrams (DDs) pure Swift implementations.

DDs are data structures capable of representing large sets of data.
They take advantage of the similarities between individual elements
to compact their representation in a graph-like structure,
and support efficient operations to manipulate multiple elements at once.

## Provided Implementations

- [x] Set Family Decision Diagrams (SFDDs)
- [x] Map Family Decision Diagrams (SFDDs)
- [ ] Data Decision Diagrams (DDDs)
- [ ] Sigma Decision Diagrams (Î£DDs)

## Installation

DDKit is provided in the form of a Swift package and can be integrated with the
[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

Add DDKit as a dependency to your package in your `Pacakge.swift` file:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  // ...
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/kyouko-taiga/DDKit.git", .branch("master")),
  ],
  // ...
)
```

Note that latest releases will always be pushed to the `master` branch of the
[github repository](https://github.com/kyouko-taiga/DDKit.git).

DD implementations are provided in the form of separated libraries.
To use one particular implementation,
add its corresponding library as a dependency of your own target:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  // ...
  targets: [
    .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: ["SFDD"]),
  ],
  // ...
)
```

You'll then be able to import DDKit's symbol into your sources:

```swift
import SFDD

let factory = Factory<String>()
```
